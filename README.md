# Peer-to-Peer Distributed File System (P2P-DFS)

A **peer-to-peer distributed file system** that enables users to collaboratively store, retrieve, and share files across multiple nodes without relying on a centralized server. This project is designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data distribution.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**:
  - Eliminates the need for a central server by utilizing a peer-to-peer network.
- **File Storage and Retrieval**:
  - Efficiently stores and retrieves files across multiple nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Ensures data availability even when some nodes are offline.
- **File Chunking**:
  - Splits files into smaller chunks for distributed storage and retrieval.
- **Node Discovery**:
  - Dynamically finds and connects to other peers in the network.
- **Data Redundancy**:
  - Optionally replicates data across multiple nodes for reliability.
